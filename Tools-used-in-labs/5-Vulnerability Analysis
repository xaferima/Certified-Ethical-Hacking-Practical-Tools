            NVD to view the latest underlying system and software vulnerabilities.
            Using nvd.nist.gov

    Perform Vulnerability Assessment using Various Vulnerability Assessment Tools
        Perform vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS
            admin and password
            Using to get vulnerabilities analysis
        Perform vulnerability scanning using Nessus
            Admin as the username and password
            Using it also
        Perform vulnerability scanning using GFI LanGuard
            30 days trial
        Perform web servers and applications vulnerability scanning using CGI Scanner Nikto
            A tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired.
            nikto -h (Target Website) -Tuning x 
            -h: specifies the target host and x: specifies the Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified).
            nikto -h (Target Website) -Cgidirs all (scans the specified CGI directories; users can use filters such as “none” or “all” to scan all CGI directories or none)
            nikto -h (Target Website) -o (File_Name) -F txt(Format)
