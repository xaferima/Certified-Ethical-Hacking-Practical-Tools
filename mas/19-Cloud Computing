Overview of S3 Buckets

S3 buckets are used by customers and end users to store text documents, PDFs, videos, images, etc. To store all these data, the user needs to create a bucket with a unique name.

Listed below are several techniques that can be adopted to identify AWS S3 Buckets:

 Inspecting HTML: Analyze the source code of HTML web pages in the background to find URLs to the target S3 buck
 Brute-Forcing URL: Use Burp Suite to perform a brute-force attack on the target bucket’s URL to identify its cort 
 Finding subdomains: Use tools such as Findsubdomains and Robtex to identify subdomains related to the target buc
 Reverse IP Search: Use search engines such as Bing to perform reverse IP search to identify the domains of the target buckets
 Advanced Google hacking: Use advanced Google search operators such as “inurl” to search for URLs related to the target buckets

    Perform S3 bucket enumeration using various S3 bucket enumeration tools
        Enumerate S3 buckets using lazys3
            ruby lazys3.rb [Company] 
        Enumerate S3 buckets using S3Scanner
            python3 ./s3scanner.py sites.txt 

             You can also use other S3 bucket enumeration tools such as S3Inspector (https://github.com), s3-buckets-bruteforcer (https://github.com), Mass3 (https://github.com), Bucket Finder (https://digi.ninja), and s3recon (https://github.com) to perform S3 bucket enumeration for a target website or company.

    Exploit S3 buckets
        Exploit open S3 buckets using AWS CLI
            Thus, you can add or delete files from open S3 buckets.

    Perform privilege escalation to gain higher privileges
        Escalate IAM user privileges by exploiting misconfigured user policy

            A policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines its permissions.
