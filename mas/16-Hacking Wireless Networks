16-Hacking Wireless Networks 

  Extension to a wired network: A wired network is extended by the introduction of access points between the wired network and wireless devices
  Multiple access points: Multiple access points connect computers wirelessly
  LAN-to-LAN wireless network: All hardware APs have the ability to interconnect with other hardware access points
  3G/4G hotspot: A mobile device shares its cellular data wirelessly with Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as MP3 players, notebooks, tablets, cameras, PDAs, and netbooks

  Attacks:
	    Fragmentation attack: When successful, such attacks can obtain 1,500 bytes of PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm)

	    MAC spoofing attack: The attacker changes their MAC address to that of an authenticated user in order to bypass the access point’s MAC-filtering configuration

	    Disassociation attack: The attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the access point and client

	    Deauthentication attack: The attacker floods station(s) with forged deauthentication packets to disconnect users from an access point

	    Man-in-the-middle attack: An active Internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read, or alter information between two computers

	    Wireless ARP poisoning attack: An attack technique that exploits the lack of a verification mechanism in the ARP protocol by corrupting the ARP cache maintained by the OS in order to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the target host

	    Rogue access points: Wireless access points that an attacker installs on a network without authorization and that are not under the management of the network administrator

	    Evil twin: A fraudulent wireless access point that pretends to be a legitimate access point by imitating another network name

	    Wi-Jacking attack: A method used by attackers to gain access to an enormous number of wireless networks


    Perform Wireless Traffic Analysis
        Wi-Fi Packet Analysis using Wireshark        
    		Here 802.11 protocol indicates wireless packets.
    		You can access the saved packet capture file anytime, and by issuing packet filtering commands in the Filter field, you can narrow down the packet search in an attempt to find packets containing sensible information.

    	You can also use other wireless traffic analyzers such as AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer PRO (https://www.netally.com), SteelCentral Packet Analyzer (https://www.riverbed.com), Omnipeek Network Protocol Analyzer (https://www.liveaction.com), CommView for Wi-Fi (https://www.tamos.com), and Capsa Portable Network Analyzer (https://www.colasoft.com) to analyze Wi-Fi traffic.

    Perform Wireless Attacks
        Crack a WEP network using Aircrack-ng
        	aircrack-ng '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Captures/WEPcrack-01.cap' 
        	The above command aircrack-ng will crack the WEP key of the CEHLabs

        Crack a WPA2 network using Aircrack-ng
        	aircrack-ng -a2 -b [Target BSSID] -w password.txt 'WPA2crack-01.cap' 

	        -a is the technique used to crack the handshake, 2=WPA technique.
	        -b refers to bssid; replace with the BSSID of the target router.
	        -w stands for wordlist; provide the path to a wordlist. 


	    You can also use other tools such as Elcomsoft Wireless Security Auditor (https://www.elcomsoft.com), Portable Penetrator (https://www.secpoint.com), WepCrackGui (https://sourceforge.net), Pyrit (https://github.com), and WepAttack (http://wepattack.sourceforge.net) to crack WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption.
