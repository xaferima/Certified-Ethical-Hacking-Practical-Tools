07-MALWARE THREATS

    Gain access to the target system using Trojans
        Gain control over a victim machine using the njRAT RAT Trojan{Remote Access Trojans (RATs) }
            njRAT is a RAT with powerful data-stealing capabilities.
            SE CONTROLA TODA LA MAQUINA CON UN SOLO CLICK.
        Hide a Trojan using SwayzCryptor and make it undetectable to various anti-virus programs
            One method that attackers use to bypass AVs is to “crypt” (an abbreviation of “encrypt”) the malicious files using fully undetectable crypters (FUDs)
        Create a server using the ProRat Tool
            ProRat is a “remote administration tool”, is capable of working with all Windows OSes
            Delete file and exchange for another one
        Create a Trojan server using Theef RAT Trojan
             It allows remote attackers access to the system via port 9871.

    Infect the target system using a virus
        Create a virus using the JPS Virus Maker Tool and infect the target system
             viruses can only infect outside machines with the assistance of computer users.
             computer worms are standalone malicious programs that independently replicate, execute, and spread across network connections, without human intervention. Worms are a subtype of virus.
             The JPS Virus Maker tool is used to create its own customized virus.
             Amazing tool

    Perform static malware analysis
            This information includes items like the malicious intent of the malware, indicators of compromise, complexity level of the intruder, exploited vulnerability, extent of damage   caused by the intrusion, perpetrator accountable for installing the malware, and system vulnerability the malware has exploited.
        Perform online malware scanning using VirusTotal
            Hybrid Analysis (https://www.hybrid-analysis.com), Cuckoo Sandbox (https://cuckoosandbox.org), Jotti (https://virusscan.jotti.org), or Valkyrie Sandbox (https://valkyrie.comodo.com) 
        Perform a strings search using BinText
            BinText is a text extractor that can extract text from any file. It includes the ability to find plain ASCII text, Unicode text, and Resource strings, providing useful information for each item.
        Identify packing and obfuscation methods using PEid
            PEid is a free tool that provides details about Windows executable files. It can identify signatures associated with over 600 different packers and compilers. This tool also displays the type of packer used in packing a program.
            Other packaging/obfuscation tools such as Macro_Pack (https://github.com), UPX (https://upx.github.io), or ASPack (http://www.aspack.com) to identify packing/obfuscation methods.
        Find the portable executable (PE) information of a malware executable file using PE Explorer
            The Portable Executable (PE) format is the executable file format used on Windows OSes that stores the information a Windows system requires to manage the executable code.
            PE Explorer lets you open, view, and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows executable file types
            Portable Executable Scanner (pescan) (https://tzworks.net), Resource Hacker (http://www.angusj.com), or PEView (https://www.aldeid.com)
        Identify file dependencies using Dependency Walker
            Finding out all library functions may allow guessing about what the malware program can do.
            Dependency-check (https://jeremylong.github.io), Snyk (https://snyk.io), Hakiri (https://hakiri.io), or RetireJS (https://retirejs.github.io) to identify file dependencies.
        Perform malware disassembly using IDA and OllyDbg
            IDA As a disassembler, IDA explores binary programs, for which the source code might not be available, to create maps of their execution.
            OllyDbg OllyDbg is a debugger that emphasizes binary code analysis, which is useful when source code is unavailable.

    Perform dynamic malware analysis
        Perform port monitoring using TCPView and CurrPorts
            You can identify the malware trying to access a particular port by installing port monitoring tools such as TCPView and CurrPorts. 
            2 list process and ports
            Tools such as Port Monitor (https://www.port-monitor.com), CurrPorts (https://www.nirsoft.net), TCP Port Monitoring (https://www.dotcom-monitor.com), or PortExpert (http://www.kcsoftwares.com) 
        Perform process monitoring using Process Monitor
             Process Explorer (https://docs.microsoft.com), OpManager (https://www.manageengine.com), Monit (https://mmonit.com), or ESET SysInspector 
        Perform registry monitoring using Regshot and jv16 PowerTools
            Regshot Regshot is a registry compare utility that helps to compare changes in registry entries after installing or uninstalling a program or manually modifying the registry. The purpose of this utility is to compare your registry at two separate points by taking a snapshot of the registry before and after any program or settings are added, removed, or otherwise modified
                Guarda snapshot para comparar
            jv16 PowerTools jv16 PowerTools is a PC system utility software that works by cleaning out unneeded files and data, cleaning the Windows registry, automatically fixing system errors, and applying optimization to your system. It allows the user to scan and monitor the Registry. 
        Perform Windows services monitoring using Windows Service Manager (SrvMan)
            ervice monitoring tools such as Advanced Windows Service Manager (https://securityxploded.com), Process Hacker (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io), Netwrix Service Monitor (https://www.netwrix.com), or AnVir Task Manager (https://www.anvir.com) to perform Windows services monitoring.
