18-IoT and OT Hacking

Overview of IoT and OT Hacking

Using the IoT and OT hacking methodology, an attacker acquires information using techniques such as information gathering, attack surface area identification, and vulnerability scanning, and uses such information to hack the target device and network.

The following are the various phases of IoT and OT device hacking:

  Information gathering
  Vulnerability scanning
  Launch attacks
  Gain remote access
  Maintain access


    Perform footprinting using various footprinting techniques
        Gather information using online footprinting tools
